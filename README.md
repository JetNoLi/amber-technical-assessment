# Technical Problem for Amber Software

## Problem Brief
The brief:
You are tasked with building an API that returns user data. This data must be displayed on the
frontend. The following requirements are given to you for implementation:
The API:
1. As a product owner, I want the API to conform to the open api standards so that our API
can be well documented and standardised.
2. As a developer, I want the below data structure to be returned so that the client application may use the relative data. 
 
The Client: 

1. As a user, I want to see my user data displayed so that I can see my data displayed in a
visually pleasing and aesthetic manner.
 
 Some info:
You can use any framework on the frontend. You can use any language and framework on the
backend. This assessment is intentionally open ended. Your submission should be pushed to a
git repo and publicly accessible.
Everything else is bonus points. Big points for anyone who writes tests.

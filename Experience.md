# What I would do If I had more time

* Implement validation using JOI (npm package)
* Implement createUser.jsx a form to Create a new user (in conjuction with the existing post method)
* Implement Loading Screen
* Use Environment Variables for Port

# Biggest Challenges

* I found the hardest problem with an assessment like this is that the open endedness leads to a sense of never being done, especially on the frontend
* A challenge which occupied alot more of my time than expected was first learning and then implementing the OpenAPI standard, particularly without changing my current stack, most notably express (route handler).
